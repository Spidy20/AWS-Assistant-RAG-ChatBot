What is the purpose of VPC in Amazon EC2?,A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It provides a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources.
What is Amazon SageMaker Processing?,"Amazon SageMaker Processing is a managed data processing service that simplifies running data preprocessing, post-processing, feature engineering, and model evaluation tasks on Amazon SageMaker."
What is AWS Lambda?,"AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by AWS, allowing you to run code without provisioning or managing servers."
What is Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor?,"Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor is a capability of Amazon SageMaker that automatically monitors machine learning models in production, detecting deviations in data quality and model behavior."
What are the components of AWS SageMaker?,"Components include Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and experimentation, training instances for model training, and hosting services for deploying machine learning models."
What is Amazon EC2 Spot Instances?,"Amazon EC2 Spot Instances allow you to bid for spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity, which can significantly reduce the cost of running your applications."
What is an AMI in Amazon EC2?,An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template that contains the software configuration (including the operating system) required to launch an EC2 instance.
What is the significance of an EC2 key pair?,"An EC2 key pair is used to securely connect to EC2 instances via SSH. It consists of a public key, which is stored on the instance, and a private key, which is kept by the user."
What are triggers in AWS Lambda?,"Triggers are events that invoke AWS Lambda functions. Examples include changes in Amazon S3 buckets, updates to DynamoDB tables, and messages from Amazon SNS."
What algorithms are supported by AWS SageMaker?,"AWS SageMaker supports a wide range of built-in algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation systems."
What languages are supported by AWS Lambda?,"AWS Lambda supports multiple programming languages including Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and Ruby."
What is Amazon EC2 Instance Store?,Amazon EC2 Instance Store provides temporary block-level storage for your instances. It is ideal for temporary storage of data that doesn't require durability or for scratch space.
What is auto-scaling in Amazon EC2?,Auto-scaling allows EC2 instances to automatically adjust the number of instances in response to changes in demand. It helps maintain application availability and optimize costs.
What is an EC2 security group?,An EC2 security group acts as a virtual firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to an EC2 instance.
What is an EC2 instance type?,"An EC2 instance type defines the virtual hardware configuration of the EC2 instance, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity."
What is the difference between on-demand and spot instances in Amazon EC2?,"On-demand instances are charged at a fixed rate per hour with no long-term commitments, while spot instances allow users to bid for unused EC2 capacity, potentially reducing costs."
What is a SageMaker notebook instance?,"A SageMaker notebook instance is a fully managed machine learning development environment that allows you to create and run Jupyter notebooks to build, train, and deploy machine learning models."
What is AWS SageMaker?,"AWS SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service provided by AWS, allowing developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale."
What is Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host?,An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. It can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.
What is Amazon EC2?,Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to rent virtual servers on which they can run their own applications.
What is an Elastic IP address in Amazon EC2?,An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. It allows users to remap their public IP addresses to any instance in their account.
How does Amazon SageMaker facilitate model deployment?,"Amazon SageMaker provides capabilities to deploy machine learning models as real-time endpoints or batch transformations, allowing applications to use the models for inference."
What is Amazon EC2 Hibernation?,"Amazon EC2 Hibernation is a feature that allows you to pause and resume EC2 instances, preserving the instance state and reducing time-to-start for instances that are not in use."
What are the benefits of using AWS Lambda?,"Benefits include automatic scaling, cost-effectiveness, reduced operational complexity, and seamless integration with other AWS services."
